# Striver’s SDE Sheet Challenge



It is a 60-day challenge in which I will be covering every question of SDE Sheet. SDE Sheet contains very handily crafted and picked top coding interview questions from different topics of Data Structures & Algorithms. These questions are one of the most asked coding interview questions in coding interviews of companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Swiggy, Flipkart, etc
